# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Give an introduction to your repository here: Eg. This repository contains a complete implementation for ...

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Describe your repository structure here. Explain about overall code organization.
Ther repository contains everything I did for this project
This readme.md file contains the instructions for how to use this
algorithms.py contains all the algorithms I tried over the course of this project
main.py contains how to use them to get predections.
report.pdf is the submission report demarkating the apporach I took and how I reached the final model
trail_and_error folder has my attemps at different techniques, I hope it is not evaluated :)

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Mention all the related instructions for installation of related packages for running your code here.
You will need pandas, numpy and sklearn.metric and time for running this code

Kindly give the path of this directory in the base_path variable and give the test file name in test_orig_file variable in main.py (and store the test file in the same folder). This code will return the prediction as a csv with name test_predictions.csv for your evaluation

currently it will output a csv with predictions for MNIST_validation as I have set it to that for now, kindly do change it to the data set you want to test it with.

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Mention the instructions to run you .py files.
  just need to do 
  python3 main.py
  or 
  python main.py

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
